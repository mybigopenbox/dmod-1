## Local testing to both local and remote k8s instant
You need to update the values.yaml as appropriate
This can be deployed to a local version of K8s cluster such as mini-kube. Again, this is outside the scope of these notes

As these instructions stand it will be deployed to the default namespace kube-public. However, this does not stop you deploying to other namespaces

1. package your helm chart
    helm package my-flask-app

2. Install the Helm chart
    helm install my-flask-app ./my-flask-app

3. If you make any changes you need to redeploy
    helm upgrade my-flask-app ./my-flask-app

4. Verify the deployment
    kubectl get pods
    kubectl get svc
    kubectl logs

With time, this would be easy to extend by defining even more variable in 'values.yml'


As it is deployed as a service the application can be hit through the service/Load balancer on port 80 or using port redirecton and node port service access
